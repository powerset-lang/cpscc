# Continuation-Passing Style C Compiler

This project hopes to determine what, if any, limitations exist in the use of a Continuation-Passing Style (CPS) intermediate representation in a compiler for a low-level systems programming language. Any overhead introduced by this functional IR would present a major roadblock in the desired lambda-calculus-based semantics.
